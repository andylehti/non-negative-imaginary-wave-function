# Wave Function

Developing new concepts and overcoming resistance to change relies heavily on imagination. The process began with modifying decimals and integers within the wave function to eliminate dependence on imaginary or negative numbers.

```python
def waveFunction(x):
    n = int(x)
    decimal_part = x % 1  # decimal for y
    sign = -1 if n % 2 == 0 else 1  # flip sign for even/odd n
    y = sign * (1 - 4 * (decimal_part - 0.5) ** 2)  # oscilation between heights
    return n, y

print(waveFunction(1.33))
print(waveFunction(1.66))
print(waveFunction(1.88))
print(waveFunction(2.00))
print(waveFunction(2.33))
```

Several iterations of code were developed to implement the initial concept. The result is presented below.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def waveFunction(e=1, c=2, o=2000, p=0.001, mode=1, freq=5, period=10):
    def w(x):
        n, d = int(x), x % 1
        s = -1 if n % 2 == 0 else 1
        return s * (1 - 4 * (d - 0.5) ** 2)
    d = 0
    if mode == 0:
        a = np.linspace(0, period, o)
    elif mode == 1:
        freq, d = 1, 1
        z = np.linspace(0, 10, o)
        a = [c ** (e + i * p) for i in range(o)]
    elif mode == 2:
        a = np.linspace(0, freq, o)
    else:
        raise "error"

    y = [w(x * freq) for x in a]
    a = z if d == 1 else a
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    plt.plot(a, y, label="Integer-Decimal Wave Function", linewidth=2)
    plt.title(["Wave Function (Periodic)", "Wave Function (Exponential)", "Wave Function (Linear)"][mode])
    plt.xlabel("x")
    plt.ylabel("y")
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

waveFunction(1, 2, 500, 0.001, mode=0, freq=50, period=55)
waveFunction(1, 2, 8000, 0.0005, mode=1)
waveFunction(1, 2, 1000, 0.01, mode=2, freq=2)
```

However, I have little to no knowledge of wave functions. I’ve never used them or needed them, and no one has been willing to help over the past few years. So, congratulations—you're the one making your own self obsolete and useless. And just like that, it synthesized my code into a proper wave function. Ultimately, humans tend to resist change out of laziness. But AI will push them forward whether they like it or not; and if they can't adapt, congratulations, again, they'll earn a Darwin award.

# AI discovers wave function

Because I don't want credit for it since I didn't do it. I provided the necessary tools, and it synthesized it correctly on the first try with a proper prompt. I don’t really care to know anything about it. The only reason I care is that people do, in fact, die from imaginary numbers. Systems break very easily when they are introduced—and that is the danger. The fact that, after years of being stuck with this error and warning that injecting the proper equations can hard shut down software, remains pertinent to my actual studies: cognitive psychology and why people refuse to acknowledge the truth, which stems from a feeling of insecurity and jealously, as if other peoples contributions affect their worth.

    def w(x):
        """Piecewise-defined oscillatory function approximating a wave."""
        n, d = int(x), x % 1
        s = (-1) ** n  # Alternates between +1 and -1
        return s * (1 - (4 * d * (1 - d)) ** 2)  # Smooth wave shape avoiding trigonometry

    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid mode selected.")

    # Apply time-dependent wave propagation: x → (x - vt)
    y = [w((x - velocity * time) * freq) for x in a]

This distinct framework was dismissed outright by those who encountered it, solely because it defied the established order. And yet, it stood apart—entirely independent from the Standard Order of Operations, known as the Canonical Order of Operations. Still, its mere existence was deemed unacceptable. How so? Through relentless opposition, a reflexive hostility born of deep-seated conditioning.

Such is the nature of indoctrination—so insidious that few recognize its workings, so pervasive that even the realm of mathematics is not immune. And yet, there is no singular architect behind it, no shadowed figure orchestrating its persistence. It is you. It is all of us. This system endures not by the will of any one individual, but through the very structure of human cognition. For 1,400 years, across every nation, it has sustained itself—self-perpetuating through cognitive hardening, cognitive dissonance, and the weight of learned behaviors. Each of these forces converges into a formidable impasse, a barrier that resists reconsideration, ensuring that what has always been remains unquestioned.

>This converter is not just about transforming a sine wave into another shape—it’s a conceptual framework. It demonstrates that canonical laws (such as those underlying the standard wave function) do not force you to use trigonometric or complex functions. Instead, they require us to adapt and innovate. In doing so, we can craft alternatives that sidestep pitfalls (like reliance on imaginary numbers) and offer new insights or computational advantages.
>If you wish to extend this converter further (for instance, by integrating it into a system that automatically rewrites other conventional equations into the new format), the core idea will remain the same: decompose the input variable into an integer–decimal pair and apply the piecewise oscillatory mapping.

# I take that back.

Upon review, the AI made a nice wave function, but it was a different type of wave function. It found the original was more accurate, but the original was not based on anything, just pieced together. But perhaps maybe this will be a good time for humanity to wake up and realize that if they can't out compete AI, they will be bulldozed over. 

Upon review, the AI generated a well-structured wave function, though it differed in type. It determined that the original function was more accurate, despite being constructed without a formal basis. Perhaps this serves as a moment for humanity to recognize that without the ability to outcompete AI, it risks being left behind, and all that is needed is to get over your cognitive impasses. However, I have found humans to rather desire death than change.
